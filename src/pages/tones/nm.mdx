## Why should I use this?

This tone indicator **{frontmatter.tag}** is used to clarify that the person writing the message is not mad at whoever the message is directed towards.

<br />

## Examples within messages

- Please don't talk about that stuff here {frontmatter.tag}
- Please don't use that term for me {frontmatter.tag}
